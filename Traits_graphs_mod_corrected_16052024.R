### Simple PCA exploration plot with data points and traits:
biplot(coll.mat.z.pca)
# plot of eigenvalues ordered from largest to the smallest.
# The number of component is determined at the point, beyond which the remaining
# eigenvalues are all relatively small and of comparable size (Jollife 2002,
# Peres-Neto, Jackson, and Somers (2005)).
### Scree plot: ###
fviz_eig(coll.mat.z.pca, addlabels = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 50))
# The first axis do not decline very rapidly!

# Extract the results, for variables, from a PCA:
pca_trait_var <- get_pca_var(coll.mat.z.pca)
pca_trait_var$coord # coordinates of variables to create a scatter plot
pca_trait_var$cos2 # represents the quality of representation for variables on
# the factor map. Itâ€™s calculated as the squared coordinates: var.cos2 = var.coord * var.coord.
pca_trait_var$contrib # contains the contributions (in percentage) of the variables
# to the principal components. The contribution of a variable (var) to a given principal
# component is (in percentage) : (var.cos2 * 100) / (total cos2 of the component).

### Total cos2 of variables on Dim.1 and Dim.2 (plot):
fviz_cos2(coll.mat.z.pca, choice = "var", axes = 1:2)
# FRB, RLD, NF, RBD, and Diam are most important.

### PCA graph of variables ###
# Color by cos2 values: quality on the factor map
# A high cos2 indicates a good representation of the variable on the principal component
# (variable positioned further outward).
# A low cos2 indicates that the variable is not perfectly represented by the PCs.
# In this case the variable is close to the center.
# For a given variable, the sum of the cos2 on all the principal components is equal to one
# If a variable is perfectly represented by only two principal components (Dim.1 & Dim.2),
# the sum of the cos2 on these two PCs is equal to one.

#### --------------------------------------- vertical barplots ---------------------------------------- ####

# (Source: ChatGPT and Google) If you have a continuous, numerical variable, it is typically more
# appropriate to use geom_col() rather than geom_bar(). Here's why: geom_col(): This geometry is specifically
# designed for creating bar plots with a continuous, numerical variable. The height of the bars directly
# represents the values of the variable.
# By default, geom_bar() calculates the count or frequency of observations within each category and
# represents them as bar heights. If your data is already summarised or includes values for
# y (height of the bars), use geom_col(). If, however, you want ggplot() to count up the number of
# rows in your dataset, use geom_bar(). geom_bar() basically runs the count() function and plots it.

# It's possible to add the data points to the barplot and eliminate the weakness
# of the error bars and bars to hide the individual data values (geom_jitter{ggplot2}).
# However, I would need to be on the "absorptive" data.frame level, and not the "sum_abs"
# data.frame level (geom_point only shows one point for the means)!
# geom_point(aes(y = RTD_g_cm3), color = "red", size = 3)

# [02/08/2023] ChatGPT: In R, when you specify a hypothesis using the car::Anova() function,

# names include arithmetic operators (e.g., *, :, +, -, etc.), it can lead to issues with the printed

# To resolve this warning message, you need to ensure that there are no arithmetic operators in
# the names of the coefficients in your hypothesis. One common reason for having arithmetic operators
# in the names is when you create interactions between variables in your model formula,
# as you have done in your lmer() function.

### emmeans (Tukeyâ€™s Honest Significant Difference Test) ###

# Carsten F. Dormann: Parametrische Statistik: Verteilungen, maximum likelihood
# und GLM in R
# S. 201: Wenn wir aber partout eine post-hoc-Test durchfÃ¼hren wollen, dann mÃ¼ssen wir
# zumindest fÃ¼r die Anzahl Vergleiche korrigieren, um so tatsÃ¤chlich bei 5 % Irrtums-
# wahrscheinlichkeit zu bleiben (Day & Quinn 1989, stellen ein hervorragende Ãœber-
# sicht zur VerfÃ¼gung). Dazu sind zwei AnsÃ¤tze verbreitet: die Bonferroni-Korrektur
# und Tukeyâ€™s honest significant difference Test.
# Tukeyâ€™s Honest Significant Difference Test (S. 202):
# Tukeyâ€™s HSD ist noch strikter in der Korrektur der paarweisen Vergleiche. Er ist
# sozusagen der akzeptiere Maximalstandard. Wenn post-hoc-Vergleiche im Tukeyâ€™s
# HSD immer noch signifikant sind, dann gibt es daran nichts zu rÃ¼tteln.
# Technisch gesehen ist Tukeyâ€™s HSD eine Variante des paarweisen t-Tests, nur
# wird statt der t-Verteilung eine studentised range distribution benutzt, weshalb der
# Test auch als Tukeyâ€™s range test bezeichnet wird.
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/vignettes/confidence-intervals.html
# pairwise comparisons default to adjust = "tukey", i.e., the Tukey HSD method.
# An adjustment method that is usually appropriate is Bonferroni; however, it can be quite conservative.
# --> see Nakagawa (2004): A farewell to Bonferroni: the problems of low statistical power and publication bias
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65002727/is-using-adjust-tukey-in-emmeans-equivalent-to-a-tukey-hsd-test
# Tukey adjustment: That adjustment is only appropriate for a single set of pairwise comparisons.
# If you specify adjust = "tukey" for non-pairwise comparisons or arbitrary contrasts,
# it will overrule you and use the "sidak" adjustment instead.
# I do pairwise comparisons on h2o High vs. Low, so emmeans should use the Tukey HSD!
# [28.07.2023] ChatGPT: Keep in mind that the decision to conduct post-hoc tests
# should be guided by your research questions and hypotheses. If you have specific
# research questions about the comparisons between certain groups, you may perform
# appropriate post-hoc tests even if the three-way interaction is not significant.
# However, it is essential to be cautious about multiple testing and consider
# controlling for Type I error rates (e.g., using Bonferroni correction) to avoid
# false-positive results.
# The above sources and reasoning provides the argument to use in my papers for
# conducting post-hoc tests in the absence of significant main effects (type 3 ANOVA)!

## After reading Popovic et al. (2024) and Smith et al. (2024), I came to the
# conclusion that the LMMs should reflect the experimental design, but
# should not involve too many random interactions. The block pairs are arbitrary
# and not reproducible --> Delete!!!

# Assuming block and block_plot are crossed random effects. I include them as
# crossed random effects because this is essentially what Stephane recommended
# before. Additionally, Alain Paquette and Stephane told me that plot is NOT
# nested in block.
# Example for nesting from: https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat503/lesson/14/14.1
# When factor B is nested in levels of factor A, the levels of the nested factor
# don't have exactly the same meaning under each level of the main factor,
# in this case factor A. In a nested design, the levels of factor (B) are not
# identical to each other at different levels of factor (A), although they might
# have the same labels. For example, if A is school and B is teacher, teacher 1
# will differ between the schools. This has to be kept in mind when trying to
# determine if the design is crossed or nested. To be crossed, the same teacher
# needs to teach at all the schools. --> In my study, the same tree species
# are present in all blocks. ==> I have a crossed, random design!
