### How to Download and Clone the Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   To clone this repository, you will need Git installed on your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Florentin85/Data_code_rootTraits_IDENT-SSM.git
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis**:
  You can open the R Quarto files and run the analysis directly. To run a specific R Quarto file, use the following R command in your R environment:

    ```r
    quarto::quarto_render("your_file.qmd")
    ```
  Replace your_file.qmd with the actual name of the R Quarto file you want to render.

3. **Explore the Data**:
  The data files are included in the directory in .csv format. You can load and explore them using standard R functions, such as read.csv() or readRDS().

4. **Reproduce the Analysis**:
  Follow the instructions in the R Quarto files to reproduce the analysis. Each file contains detailed comments and explanations of the code and steps.

5. **Report Issues**:
  If you encounter any issues or have questions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository or contact me directly at the email provided below.

# Methodology and variables explained
| **Explanation** | **Name** |
| ----------- | ---- |
Identification rock volume | ID_rock
tree species | sp
Resolution in WinRhizo set to 500 dpi | resolution
day of year 2018 | day of year
date of field sampling | sampling date
root fraction (absorptive fine roots AF, transportive fine roots TF, coarse roots C, dead roots D, fragments F (<1 cm length) | fraction
fresh weight gram with 100 % fragments added to AF and D (F multiplied by 10 to get from 10 % to 100 % root fragments and distributed proportionally according to the fractions sorted by species and live and dead fine roots.) | fresh weight aff
partial fresh weight gram | part fresh w
dry weight gram | dry weight
dry weight gram fragments 100 % (F x 10) | dry weight f 100
calculated total dry weight in grams (g) | calc tot dry weight
total dry weight gram with F = 100 %, same method as for fresh weight aff. Excel formula: f100 / (AF + D) x AF + AF = af proportional (same formula according to D --> … (D + … ) x D + D | tot dry weight aff
Percentage fragments on tot dry weight aff | f perc prop weight aff
volume calculated rocks in milliliters (ml) per sample (strata: 5 cm and 10 cm) | vol calc sk ml
% skeleton in soil corer per stratum --> (vol calc sk ml / soil vol cm^-3^) x 100 | vol perc sk
vol fine soil cm^-3^ -->  volume corer - volume skeleton | vol fine cm^-3^
day of dry roots weighing | date dry weighing
Soil volume in m^-3^ from the root corer, diameter 5.08 cm and height of soil cores 5 and 10 cm respectively (0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20 & 20-30 cm depth) | soil vol m^-3^
Fine root biomass = tot dry weight aff in gram / volume fine soil in cubic centimeter (Fine root biomass is fine root density in this case, biomass is related to m^-2^ and not cm^-3^) | FRB g cm^-3^
Specific root length = meters root length aff 100 cm divided by 100 (to get meters) divided by total dry weight aff (gram) | SRL m g^-1^
Root length density = (length aff cm / 100) / (vol fine cm^-3^ / 1000000) One million to get m^-3^. | RLD m m^-3^
We noted, if there was mycelium present in the scan --> Yes/No (Changed grey scale to get best scan result!) | mycelium
length from WinRhizo (total length per fraction, each fraction was scanned individually) | length cm
length from WinRhizo for fractions C & TF. F multiplied by 10 to get 100 % fine root fragments. Formula: f100 / (AF + D) x AF + AF --> to get length from F100 % proportionally distributed according to AF & D. Same for D. | length aff cm
Average root volume from WinRhizo --> Wrong calculation!!! --> WinRhizo assumes roots are perfect cylinders! | rootvol cm^-3^
Sum of the root volume per diameter class from WinRhizo in cubic centimeter (10 classes, 5 mm each) | rootvol class cm^-3^
Sum root volume for diameter classes. Volume from WinRhizo for fractions C & TF. F multiplied by 10 to get 100 % fine root fragments. Formula: f100 / (AF + D) x AF + AF --> to get volume from F100 % proportionally distributed according to AF & D. Same for D. | rootvol aff class cm^-3^
Root Tissue Density (RTD) --> Total dry weight aff / root vol aff class cm^-3^ | rtd g cm^-3^
number of root tips per root length (length aff cm). Fragments **NOT** multiplied by 10 and **NOT** distributed proportionally according to AF and D, because WinRhizo would consider fragments ends as root tips and this would be unrealistic! (same with forks) | ntips n length cm^-1^
Root dry matter content (RDMC) dry g / fresh g -->  total dry weight aff / fresh weight aff | rdmc dry g^-1^ fresh g^-1^
